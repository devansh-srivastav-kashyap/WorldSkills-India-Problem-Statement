# WorldSkills-India-Problem-Statement

This repo contains a LABVIEW file. In that file, I have designed a digital device which counts till 12 and as soon as it reaches 12, the device will trigger a buzzer and device will reset itself. I made the Mealy State Graph and using the concept of State Machine, i executed the operation.

To use the file, download LABVIEW.

You can simply download this file and use it directly.
